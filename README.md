# CodeJam - Getting Started with Machine Learning using SAP HANA and Python

## Description

This repository contains the material for the CodeJam on "Getting Started with Machine Learning using SAP HANA and Python".

In this CodeJam you will learn how the Machine Learning process develops using a Python Client for SAP HANA.

## Requirements

The requirements necessary to complete the exercises in this repository, including hardware and software specifications, are outlined in the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) file.

### Material organization

The material comprises a series of exercises, with each exercise being a Jupyter notebook to be executed.

### Following the exercises

During the CodeJam, you will complete each exercise one at a time. Within each exercise, there are discussion points to be discussed upon with the entire CodeJam class, facilitated by the instructor and marker using the notation "ðŸ¤“ **Let's discuss**".

If you complete any exercise ahead of others, kindly refrain from moving on to the next one. Instead, take the opportunity to delve deeper into what you've just accomplished and explore additional aspects of the covered subject matter. This approach ensures that we all progress together and can derive additional value through reflection via the questions (and answers).

### The exercises

Here's an overview of the exercises in this CodeJam.
